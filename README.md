# Payup

## Description

A synchronous + asynchronous payment library for processing payments with rust. Work in progress. Stripe is quasi-supported if you don't need the full api.

I built this library due to a lack of synchronous payment libraries. 

Roadmap:
* 0.1.0: Quasi-Stripe Support
    * Ability to list/create Customers (DONE)
    * Ability to list/create Plans (DONE)

    * Ability to list/create PaymentMethods (WIP)
    * Ability to list/create Subscriptions (WIP)
    * Ability to get/create Tokens (WIP)
    * Ability to list/create Charges (WIP)
    * Ability to list/create Payouts (WIP)

* 0.2.0: Full Stripe API Support
* 0.3.0: Paypal Support
* 0.4.0: Cryptocurrency Support

## How to use library

Add the following line to your cargo.toml:
```
